# Landing Web Design Clients — 14 Methods

Personal reference guide. Source: Self-Made Web Designer (YouTube).

**Core principle:** Try one method seriously for 2–3 months before switching. What works for one person may not work for another. Stack multiple methods once you find your groove.

---

## 1. The Field of Dreams Method

Build the website *first*, then pitch it to the business owner.

- Find a local small business with an outdated or weak site.
- Redesign it speculatively — use their real photos, write copy that fits their messaging.
- Get them on a call and offer to sell it.
- Works because you remove all imagination from the equation. They see the finished product, not a promise.
- Best for simple brochure sites: landscapers, HVAC, electricians, service businesses.
- Price range: $1,000–$2,000 each. High volume model — 5/month = $5k–$10k.
- If they say no, recustomize the same site for a different business.

## 2. The First 100 Framework

Activate your existing network as a referral army.

- Write a list of 100 people you know. Not business owners — just humans. Friends, family, coworkers, neighbors, your barista.
- Send each one a simple message: *"I'm building my web design business. If you hear of anyone needing a website or starting a business, would you mind sending them my way?"*
- You're not asking them to hire you. You're asking them to keep their eyes open.
- Trust is already baked in — these people know you.
- Even if none of the 100 hire you, they know people who might.

## 3. The Loom Zoom Boom

Record short personalized video audits for businesses and send them unsolicited.

- Find a business with a site that needs help (slow, not mobile-friendly, no clear CTA, etc.).
- Record a Loom/Zoom video walking through specific, helpful observations.
- **Don't roast them.** Be genuinely helpful for free.
- Examples of things to point out:
  - Slow homepage load time + a simple fix
  - Missing call-to-action above the fold
  - Broken mobile layout
- End with a soft CTA: *"If you're ever interested in updating the site, I'd love to help. Either way, thanks for letting me share my thoughts."*
- Do 2–3 of these per day. Consistency is key.
- This works because almost nobody puts in this level of effort.

## 4. The FIG Portfolio Method

Build a portfolio from scratch using fake businesses.

- Pick a niche you're excited about (coffee shops, coaches, barbershops, yoga studios, etc.).
- Use ChatGPT to generate 3 fake businesses: names, services, placeholder copy, backstory.
- Design a **full** website for each — not just a homepage. Include services page, contact page, etc.
- Treat these like real projects. Don't just slap a template together.
- This lets you attract the *kind* of clients you actually want.
- If you have zero portfolio pieces, start with your own personal site. Be your own first client.

**Story:** Ariel pulled down her entire existing portfolio, rebuilt it with fake projects matching her dream clients, and started consistently landing $30k projects.

## 5. The Social Stalker Strategy

Find potential clients on social media and build genuine connection before pitching.

- Google businesses you'd love to work with.
- Follow them on whichever platform they're *actively* using (not a dead LinkedIn profile).
- Engage authentically: comment on posts, like their content, tell them what you appreciated.
- After consistent engagement, reach out with genuine curiosity — not a pitch.
- Example: *"Hey, I saw you're working on [project]. I'm a web designer and I love helping businesses build a strong online presence. If you ever need support on that side, I'd love to help."*
- Do this a few times per week.

## 6. Freelancer Hubs

Use platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, and Toptal to find real posted opportunities.

Three keys to winning:

1. **Stand out.** Speak directly to the client's pain points. Be personal. No copy-paste proposals.
2. **Filter the right jobs.** Don't apply for everything. Focus on jobs where your skillset is exactly what they need.
3. **Be fast.** Responding within 5 minutes makes you 25% more likely to land the client vs. responding in 30 minutes. Turn on alerts. Get the mobile app.

Momentum compounds — first win leads to credibility, reviews, and more wins.

## 7. Job Boards

Not just for full-time jobs — many companies post contract and freelance work too.

Good boards to check:
- We Work Remotely
- Remote OK
- AngelList
- Dribbble / Behance
- Reddit subreddits (r/forhire, r/webdev, etc.)

**Check daily**, not weekly. Treat it like morning news. The people who land the best gigs are scanning often and applying fast.

## 8. The AI Overlord (ChatGPT-Assisted Outreach)

Use ChatGPT to research leads and write pitches.

1. Tell ChatGPT about your business in detail — services, ideal clients, style, strengths.
2. Ask it to do in-depth research and find 5 real businesses that would benefit from your skillset.
3. Have it write a personalized pitch for each.

## 9. Local Leverage

Find and serve businesses in your physical area.

- Set up a **Google My Business** profile. Keep it simple: a few portfolio examples, your service area, office hours.
- Ask friends (and past clients if you have them) to leave reviews.
- People search locally and trust reviews — a few five-star ratings puts you ahead of most freelancers.

More local tactics:
- Walk into businesses downtown and ask to speak with the owner (the "Alan method").
- Join your local Chamber of Commerce.
- Offer a free workshop at a coworking space or library.
- Post in local Facebook groups or Nextdoor: *"I'm a local web designer looking to help businesses. If you or someone you know needs a website, let's talk."*
- Works in small towns and suburbs too — everyone needs a web presence.

## 10. The Strategic Collab

Partner with adjacent freelancers/professionals who serve your ideal clients.

- Find people whose work complements yours: logo designers, brand strategists, photographers, copywriters, social media managers.
- Propose a mutual referral arrangement: you send them clients who need their services, they send you clients who need websites.
- Join Facebook or Slack communities where these creatives hang out.
- Also consider partnering with **other web designers** who are booked out and need overflow help.

Key: Don't just take referrals — give them too.

## 11. Secret Santa (Creative Gifting Outreach)

Send potential clients an unexpected, thoughtful gift to get their attention.

- Pick businesses you'd love to work with.
- Research their brand, mission, interests — follow them on social media.
- Send something that resonates: a book, event tickets, something personal.
- Include a note, a link, or a QR code leading back to you and your services.
- Lead with generosity. Give first, ask second.
- Very few people do this, which is exactly why it stands out.

## 12. Content King

Create helpful content that attracts your ideal clients to you.

- You don't need 10 years of experience. Being a few steps ahead of your audience is enough.
- Content ideas:
  - What should go on a homepage
  - Mistakes to avoid when launching a website
  - How to hire a web designer
  - Document your process of building your business (vlogging)
- Pick **one channel** (social media, blog, YouTube) and post 1–2x per week.
- Use ChatGPT to brainstorm ideas, write captions, and plan a content calendar.
- Over time, you become the person people think of when they need a website.

## 13. Online Communities

Join communities of entrepreneurs (not designers) and be helpful.

- Show up, answer questions, give thoughtful feedback.
- No hard pitching. Just become known as the go-to web person in the group.
- This is a long game that builds an entire business through generosity and consistency.

**Story:** Anthony Tran built his entire web design business this way — just being helpful in one online entrepreneur community.

## 14. Mix and Match

Combine and rotate methods based on your current situation.

- Calendar wide open? → Content creation, community engagement, social stalking.
- Need clients fast? → Job boards, Upwork, Loom outreach, Field of Dreams.
- Example stack: FIG Portfolio + Google My Business + ChatGPT research + Loom outreach.

The goal is a **system you can shift** as needs change. Never be fully dependent on one source. If you can adapt, you'll always know how to generate new business.
