# The $10,000 Web Design Sales Call Script

Personal reference guide. Source: Self-Made Web Designer (YouTube).

**Core principle:** Use an outline so you never hit awkward silence. The call has four sections: Discovery → Solutions → Process → Close.

---

## 1. Discovery

Goal: Figure out what the client needs, who they are, and whether you can help. **Let the client do 70%+ of the talking.**

> "When you talk, you're not in control. You stay in control by asking questions." — Chris Do

### Ask Heart Questions First

Heart questions = big picture, transformation, what they actually care about. Features don't sell — transformation does. Don't lead with "you get X pages on Y platform with Z page speed."

- What inspired you to start this project?
- Where do you hope to be in five years?
- What kind of impact do you want this project to have?
- **Always ask:** "At the end of this project, how can we know that we were *hugely* successful? Not just a little successful — hugely successful?"

### Then Ask Head Questions

Head questions = practical project details. Less important at this stage, but you need a rough sense of scope.

- How many pages do you need?
- What's your timeline?
- What platform do you want it built on?

**Don't wing it.** Have fallback questions ready for when nerves are high. (The video references a free list of 100 client questions.)

## 2. Solutions

Take what they told you and present a solution for where they're going.

**Key mindset shifts:**

- **Check if a website is even the right solution.** Sometimes they need messaging help, branding, or social media strategy instead. Don't default to "you need a website" just because that's what you sell.
- **Position yourself as a coach/consultant, not just a designer.** You're an advocate for their business, helping them think bigger than just launching a site. This is what lets you command higher prices.
- **Don't overpromise to land the project.** Unrealistic expectations → unhappy clients → no referrals. The referral is more valuable than the paycheck. A $5k project can turn into $100k+ in referred work over time.

---

## 3. Process

Share your process for how you'd execute the project.

- **Your process does the selling.** Having any defined process — even a simple one — sets you apart from 99% of web designers who shoot from the hip.
- After sharing, give them space: *"After all of that, do you have any questions for me?"*
- **Don't over-explain.** People read over-explanation as a sign of dishonesty. Stick to simple, confident answers.

## 4. The Close

This is the scripted part. Follow it step by step.

### Step 1: Ask for Their Budget

> "Do you have a budget in mind for a project like this?"

**Never be the first to name a firm price.** This has led to underbidding way below what clients were willing to pay.

### Step 2: Give Three Broad Ranges

Most clients will say "I'm not sure, just getting some ideas on pricing." That's normal. Respond with three tiers:

| Tier | What It Represents | Example (his numbers) |
|---|---|---|
| Level 1 | Minimum — worth getting out of bed for | $3,000–$5,000 |
| Level 2 | Sweet spot — where you like to be for most projects | $5,000–$7,000 |
| Level 3 | "Heck yeah" price — pie in the sky | $7,000–$20,000 |

**Keep ranges broad.** Don't say $3,000–$3,500 — that kills your flexibility later. Big gaps give the client room to self-select and give you room to negotiate.

### Step 3: Ask Where They Fall

> "Where do you fall in those ranges?"

Then **let the silence do the work.** Don't fill it. Don't panic-offer a discount. They're evaluating — that's normal. They almost always tell you where they'd like to be.

### Step 4: Schedule the Next Call

> "Let me do this — why don't I make a proposal and send it to you? Then let's jump on a call in a couple days so I can answer any questions. How does that sound?"

**Book the follow-up call right then and there.** If they say "let me get back to you" without a date on the calendar, they're probably not getting back to you.

### Step 5: Send the Proposal Fast

- Ideally within a couple hours of the call.
- Absolute maximum: 24 hours.
- This keeps momentum alive. Don't let them talk to other freelancers and forget about you.
- Don't be the designer who had a great call and then ghosted. It happens constantly.

### Step 6: Close on the Follow-Up Call

The second call is where you close. With this framework, the close rate is near 100%.

## Key Reminders

- **Talk less, listen more.** 70/30 in the client's favor minimum.
- **Heart before head.** Transformation sells, features don't.
- **Never name your price first.** Let them anchor or give ranges.
- **Silence is your friend** during the budget conversation.
- **Always leave with the next call booked.** No "I'll get back to you."
- **Send the proposal fast.** Hours, not days.
- **The referral is worth more than the project.** Protect the relationship.
