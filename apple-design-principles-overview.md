# Apple Human Interface Guidelines — Web Frontend Design Reference

> Adapted from [Apple's Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/) for use in web and frontend application design. These principles are platform-agnostic distillations of Apple's design philosophy, optimized for agents building web UIs.

## Core Design Philosophy

Apple's design system rests on four foundational principles:

1. **Clarity** — Every element should be legible at a glance. Typography, iconography, and spacing communicate hierarchy and focus. Eliminate ambiguity.
2. **Deference** — The UI should never overshadow the content. The interface exists to support user tasks, not to draw attention to itself.
3. **Depth** — Use visual layers, transitions, and motion to convey hierarchy and spatial relationships. Translucency, shadows, and scaling create a sense of structure.
4. **Consistency** — Leverage familiar patterns and components. When users encounter standard controls behaving in expected ways, they can focus on the app's unique value rather than learning new interaction paradigms.

These principles often create tension — for example, visual distinctiveness vs. consistency with platform conventions. **Apple generally favors consistency**, because the cognitive benefits of familiar patterns outweigh marginal visual differentiation.

## How to Use These Files

Each file covers a specific design domain. They are written as actionable guidelines an agent can follow when building or reviewing web frontends:

| File | Domain |
|------|--------|
| `01-layout.md` | Layout, spacing, responsive design, grids |
| `02-typography.md` | Font choices, sizing, hierarchy, readability |
| `03-color.md` | Color usage, semantic colors, palettes |
| `04-dark-mode.md` | Dark mode design, elevation, backgrounds |
| `05-accessibility.md` | Contrast, keyboard nav, screen readers, ARIA |
| `06-motion-animation.md` | Transitions, easing, reduced motion |
| `07-feedback-loading.md` | Progress indicators, loading states, user feedback |
| `08-navigation.md` | Navigation patterns, hierarchy, search |
| `09-components.md` | Buttons, forms, modals, alerts, lists, tables |
| `10-iconography-imagery.md` | Icons, images, SF Symbols principles |
| `11-branding.md` | Brand expression within consistent design |

## Key Takeaway for Web Agents

The best interfaces disappear — users focus entirely on accomplishing their goals. Design choices should reduce friction, not showcase creativity. Every pixel of whitespace, every font weight choice, and every color decision should serve the user's task.
